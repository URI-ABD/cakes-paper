However, few works have explored the use of {GANs} for the anomaly detection task. We leverage recently developed {GAN} models for anomaly detection, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on image and network intrusion datasets, while being several hundred-fold faster at test time than the only published {GAN}-based method.},

  abstract = {The ability of the Generative Adversarial Networks ({GANs}) framework to learn generative models mapping from simple latent distributions to arbitrarily complex data distributions has been demonstrated empirically, with compelling results showing that the latent space of such generators captures semantic variation in the data distribution. Intuitively, models trained to predict these semantic latent representations given data may serve as useful feature representations for auxiliary problems where semantics are relevant. However, in their existing form, {GANs} have no means of learning the inverse mapping – projecting data back into the latent space. We propose Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks ({BiGANs}) as a means of learning this inverse mapping, and demonstrate that the resulting learned feature representation is useful for auxiliary supervised discrimination tasks, competitive with contemporary approaches to unsupervised and self-supervised feature learning.},

  abstract   = {Surveillance videos are able to capture a variety of realistic anomalies. In this paper, we propose to learn anomalies by exploiting both normal and anomalous videos. To avoid annotating the anomalous segments or clips in training videos, which is very time consuming, we propose to learn anomaly through the deep multiple instance ranking framework by leveraging weakly labeled training videos, i.e. the training labels (anomalous or normal) are at videolevel instead of clip-level. In our approach, we consider normal and anomalous videos as bags and video segments as instances in multiple instance learning ({MIL}), and automatically learn a deep anomaly ranking model that predicts high anomaly scores for anomalous video segments. Furthermore, we introduce sparsity and temporal smoothness constraints in the ranking loss function to better localize anomaly during training.},

But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.}

This article proposes a method called Isolation Forest (iForest), which detects anomalies purely based on the concept of isolation without employing any distance or density measure---fundamentally different from all existing methods.As a result, iForest is able to exploit subsampling (i) to achieve a low linear time-complexity and a small memory-requirement and (ii) to deal with the effects of swamping and masking effectively. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest outperforms ORCA, one-class SVM, LOF and Random Forests in terms of AUC, processing time, and it is robust against masking and swamping effects. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems containing a large number of irrelevant attributes, and when anomalies are not available in training sample.},

  abstract  = {Most existing model-based approaches to anomaly detection construct a profile of normal instances, then identify instances that do not conform to the normal profile as anomalies. This paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points. To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and Random Forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we propose a new definition of distance-based outlier that considers for each point the sum of the distances from its k nearest neighbors, called weight. Outliers are those points having the largest values of weight. In order to compute these weights, we find the k nearest neighbors of each point in a fast and efficient way by linearizing the search space through the Hilbert space filling curve. The algorithm consists of two phases, the first provides an approximated solution, within a small factor, after executing at most d + 1 scans of the data set with a low time complexity cost, where d is the number of dimensions of the data set. During each scan the number of points candidate to belong to the solution set is sensibly reduced. The second phase returns the exact solution by doing a single scan which examines further a little fraction of the data set. Experimental results show that the algorithm always finds the exact solution during the first phase after d- 《 d + 1 steps and it scales linearly both in the dimensionality and the size of the data set.},

  abstract = {In supervised learning it has been shown that a collection of weak classifiers can result in a strong classifier with error rates similar to those of more sophisticated methods. In unsupervised learning, namely in anomaly detection such a paradigm has not yet been demonstrated despite the fact that many methods have been devised as counterparts to supervised binary classifiers. This work partially fills the gap by showing that an ensemble of very weak detectors can lead to a strong anomaly detector with a performance equal to or better than state of the art methods. The simplicity of the proposed ensemble system (to be called Loda) is particularly useful in domains where a large number of samples need to be processed in real-time or in domains where the data stream is subject to concept drift and the detector needs to be updated on-line. Besides being fast and accurate, Loda is also able to operate and update itself on data with missing variables. Loda is thus practical in domains with sensor outages. Moreover, Loda can identify features in which the scrutinized sample deviates from the majority. This capability is useful when the goal is to find out what has caused the anomaly. It should be noted that none of these favorable properties increase Loda's low time and space complexity. We compare Loda to several state of the art anomaly detectors in two settings: batch training and on-line training on data streams. The results on 36 datasets from UCI repository illustrate the strengths of the proposed system, but also provide more insight into the more general questions regarding batch-vs-on-line anomaly detection.},

  abstract  = {For many KDD applications, such as detecting criminal activities in E-commerce, finding the rare instances or the outliers, can be more interesting than finding the common patterns. Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local outlier factor (LOF) of an object. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.},

	abstract = {Biological sequence alignment using computational power has received increasing attention as technology develops. It is important to predict if a novel DNA sequence is potentially dangerous by determining its taxonomic identity and functional characteristics through sequence identification. This task can be facilitated by the rapidly increasing amounts of biological data in DNA and protein databases thanks to the corresponding increase in computational and storage costs. Unfortunately, the growth in biological databases has caused difficulty in exploiting this information. EnTrance presents an approach that can expedite the analysis of this large database by employing entropy scaling. This allows scaling with the amount of entropy in the database instead of scaling with the absolute size of the database. Since DNA and protein sequences are biologically meaningful, the space of biological sequences demonstrates the structure exploited by entropy scaling. As biological sequence databases grow, taking advantage of this structure can be extremely beneficial for reducing query times. EnTrance, the entropy scaling search algorithm introduced here, accelerates the biological sequence search exemplified by tools such as BLAST. EnTrance does this by utilizing a two step search approach. In this fashion, EnTrance quickly reduces the number of potential matches before more exhaustively searching the remaining sequences. Tests of EnTrance show that this approach can lead to improved query times. However, constructing the required entropy scaling indices beforehand can be challenging. To improve performance, EnTrance investigates several ideas for accelerating index build time that supports entropy scaling searches. In particular, EnTrance makes full use of the concurrency features of Go language greatly reducing the index build time. Our results identify key tradeoffs and demonstrate that there is potential in using these techniques for sequence similarity searches. Finally, EnTrance returns more matches and higher percentage identity matches when compared with existing tools.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
